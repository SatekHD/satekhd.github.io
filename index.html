      <p>Let me introduce myself, I'm Chris, owner of the YouTube channel "Satek". If you are here, then that means you've found my website link in the description of one of my videos, and I thank you for taking the time to check it out. On this website, you will find downloads used from my videos, links to every single one of my videos, donations, and hopefully sometime in the future, a forums area where we can create our own community. To build our own community, would be absoulutely amazing, because I love interacting with you guys, and I always appreciate the support you guys give! A few years ago, I started a YouTube channel called "VastGaming". I uploaded videos on that channel for over a year and reached about 340 subscribers. Today, I've only been uploading about 2-3 months, and have already surpassed 300, which is amazing! The little amount of time it took to reach 300 compared to my first channel is mind blowing, and it doesn't stop! When starting the channel "Satek", my goal was to be more professional than my last channel, be open with you guys, and most importantly have fun. I was never here for the money, as actually I started YouTube when money was low for everyone because that's not why I was here. If that were the reason, I would've never created a YouTube channel right now specifically because Ad Revenue is low. I just wanted to give a brief thank you to you guys! You guys are awesome, feel free to check out my social media below, and most importantly stay tuned for more videos</p>
